I'm trying to contact the original developer and would like them to review the changes that I've made and see if they want to update their code on [greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/436813-geoguessr-unity-script). 95% of the code is original, I just wanted to fix some ui issues and get the satellite mode to work.

There is a bug that causes the satellite map to display the wrong location sometimes. If it's a real problem, and not just an annoyance, I'll try to fix it.
