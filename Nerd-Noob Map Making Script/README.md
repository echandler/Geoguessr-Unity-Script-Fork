* Basic instructions video -> [youtube video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8NAp4fHta0).
* Add [Unity Nerd] for solid rectangles, or [Unity Noob] for outlines to your map name. That will trigger the Unity script into action.
* Remove a rectangle by making it small horizontaly. May have to delete the location, save map, refresh window, and then try again to bring back the hidden rectangle. Or hide one rectangle behind the other.
* The information is saved in the latitude and longitude coordinates, so even if the Unity script is not installed the map should function normally.
